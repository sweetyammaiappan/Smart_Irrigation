# Smart_Irrigation
This project, titled Smart Irrigation, focuses on analyzing and preparing sensor-based agricultural data to optimize irrigation practices. Using a dataset that includes 19 environmental sensor readings and 3 parcel-based output labels, the goal is to lay the groundwork for a machine learning model that can intelligently predict irrigation needs. The initial notebook performs essential steps such as loading the dataset, cleaning unnecessary columns, exploring the structure and summary statistics of the data, and organizing it into feature (X) and label (y) sets. These preparatory steps are crucial for building an efficient and accurate predictive model in the next phase. The project aims to support sustainable farming by helping automate irrigation decisions based on real-time sensor inputs, ultimately conserving water and improving crop health.
